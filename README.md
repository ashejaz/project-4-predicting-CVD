For this group project, a series of supervised machine learning models were created and optimised to predict cardiovascular disease based on risk factors.

## Data Source

Our Cardiovascular Risk Factor dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset), with the original source of the data being sourced from the 2021 [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) data collected by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC). The BRFSS is the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world, collecting data from U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. 

The Kaggle dataset consists of a condensed version of the BRFSS, including whether an individual did or did not have heart disease as well as 18 risk factors for heart disease identified by the publisher. The dataset was downloaded in [CSV format](Resources/CVD_dataset_uncleaned.csv) and was then uploaded to a public [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSDchXr1EhgCSsxlxJ3lWPhh1kT5EJS3yv4DJ2YLeMIC3y4uq-Pp4EQknrs9zAiaI3ulne2Jyi6gR6G/pub?gid=602879552&single=true&output=csv) for easier access.
